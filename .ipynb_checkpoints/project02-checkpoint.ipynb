While you could likely load the entire dataset into Pandas on your laptop, if you wanted to work with more than one year, this would quickly become difficult (the data is available for 1987-2018). Therefore, we will filter down the dataset into two smaller files without ever reading the larger dataset fully into memory. We are going to create two smaller datasets:\n",

    "\n",
    "To do this, you are going to use the `chunksize=N` keyword in Pandas `read_csv` to read the flights dataset in blocks of `N` lines. When you use this keyword argument, `pd.read_csv(fp, chunksize=N)` becomes a *iterator* that iterates through dataframes of length N until you have reached the end of the dataset. A typical pattern looks like:\n",

    "2. Filtering out rows of each chunk\n",
    "3. Incrementally add to a filtered csv file (since the data is perhaps too big to keep in memory). Keep in mind, if you want to keep writing to the same file, the mode='a' keyword in the `.to_csv` method can be helpful when calling it in the loop (a stands for 'append')\n",

    "1. `get_jb_sw` which takes in a filepath containing all flights and an filepath where filtered dataset #2 is written. The function should return `None`.\n",
